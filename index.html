                        <p>Midway upon the journey of our life<br> 
                            I found myself within a forest dark,<br> 
                            For the straightforward pathway had been lost. <br>
                         
                            Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say </br>
                                What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, <br>
                            Which in the very thought renews the fear. <br>
                            So bitter is it, death is little more; <br>
                                But of the good to treat, which there I found, <br>
                                Speak will I of the other things I saw there. <br>
                            <br> 
                            I cannot well repeat how there I entered, <br>
                                So full was I of slumber at the moment <br>
                                In which I had abandoned the true way. <br>
                            </p>

                        <p>But after I had reached a mountain's foot,<br> 
                            At that point where the valley terminated, <br>
                           Which had with consternation pierced my heart, <br>
                
                          Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,<br> 
                            Vested already with that planet's rays <br>
                           Which leadeth others right by every road. <br>

                            Then was the fear a little quieted <br>
                                That in my heart's lake had endured throughout <br>
                                The night, which I had passed so piteously. <br>
                                <br>
                                And even as he, who, with distressful breath, <br>
                                Forth issued from the sea upon the shore, <br>
                                Turns to the water perilous and gazes; <br>
                                <br>
                                So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward, <br>
                                Turn itself back to re-behold the pass <br>
                                Which never yet a living person left.<br>
